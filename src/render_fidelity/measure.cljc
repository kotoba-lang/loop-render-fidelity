  "What one document tells us about the renderer.

  ## The oracle is a second implementation, not a fixture

  `pdf.core/extract-text` collects the strings shown between `BT` and `ET`
  with no matrices and no state machine. It is useless for placing anything,
  which is why `hanmen` exists — and that uselessness is exactly what makes
  it a good witness: it shares no code with the interpreter, so the two
  agreeing about WHICH CHARACTERS are on a page is evidence, and the two
  disagreeing is a defect in one of them.

  Compared with all whitespace removed. Where the characters land is
  `hanmen`'s business and this cannot check it; whether it invented or lost
  any is checkable, and is the failure that actually happened: a coalescer
  once put a space between every pair of letters, and 6,289 characters
  nobody wrote went into the text of 45 documents.

  Only pages whose fonts are all simple are compared. `extract-text` cannot
  read a composite font at all — it has no CMap and no `/ToUnicode` — so on
  those pages `hanmen` legitimately knows more, and demanding agreement
  would be demanding it be as wrong as the witness.

  ## Metrics are counts of things, not scores

  Nothing here produces a number out of ten. Every field is a count of
  something a person can go and look at: marks by kind, regions left
  undrawn by reason, pages where the two readers disagree. A score would
  hide which of those moved."
