  "Whether a run is better than the last one, or worse.

  ## Why a baseline and not a threshold

  There is no number of undrawn regions that is *correct*. What is knowable
  is whether today's run has more of them than yesterday's over the same
  corpus, and that comparison needs a recorded previous run rather than a
  constant somebody chose.

  So the gate is a **ratchet**: metrics that should only fall may not rise,
  metrics that should only rise may not fall, and anything else is
  reported without an opinion. A ratchet is also what makes the loop safe
  to run often — it cannot be satisfied by lowering a bar.

  ## The corpus moves, so rates are compared and counts are not

  Documents come and go from a local corpus — a file syncs, a cloud
  placeholder evicts. Comparing raw counts across runs would call that a
  regression. Rates over what was actually measured survive it, and the
  ratchet uses those; the counts go in the ledger for a person to read.

  One exception, and it is the important one: **invented characters are
  compared as a count, and the only acceptable count is zero.** A rate would
  let a hundred fabricated characters hide behind a bigger corpus."
